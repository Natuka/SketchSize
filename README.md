# Known Issues:

1.The plugin can scale every element in the artboard, stroke, include radius、text and borders
2.Symbol processing will be optimized in the next version
3.Do not put the symbol "/" in the name of the dartboard，The processed file names the artboard according to the sketch rules，Convenient for you to automatically output in one folder
4.The resulting artboard are 1 times the size of the map, you can output actual size by yourself：）
